## Instructions & Story
* __You are the core committer.__
    * Choose an open source project and help that project by sorting code to proper branches.
    * Collect stars to make your project more popular.

* allow the code blocks to hit the related branch color
    * good: ![](http://committer.meteor.com/img/tutorial-good.png)
    * bad: ![](http://committer.meteor.com/img/tutorial-bad.png)
* destroy the blocks that do not match the branch color using your attack lasers ([SPACE])
* branches change if you destroy matching blocks or a  block
    * when the branch changes, it lights up and the code starts flowing from a different direction

* __you lose health if you mismatch the code & branch colors__ or __destroy good code blocks__
* when stars  get to the branch, collect then with your committer
* use branch teleporting ([TAB]) and 3D view ([E]) to your advantage
* the game gets harder over time, be prepared!
