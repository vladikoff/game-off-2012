## Story

## Instructions
* allow the code blocks to hit the related branch color
* i.e. good: ![alt text](public/img/tutorial-good.png ""), bad: ![alt text](public/img/tutorial-bad.png "")
* destroy the blocks that do not match the branch color
* branches change if you destroy matching blocks or a  block
* the game gets harder over time, be prepared!
* you lose health if you mismatch the colors or destroy good code
* when stars  get to the branch, collect then with your committer
* use branch teleporting (tab) and 3D view to your advantage
